Abstract: K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm plays a significant role in various fields of data science and machine learning. Most variants of the KNN algorithm involve distance computations and a parameter (K) that represents the required number of neighbors. The recent research regarding distance computations and finding the optimal value of K have made neighborhood extraction a slow process. This research presents a fast geometrical approach for neighborhood extraction from multi-dimensional data. Instead of distance computations, the proposed algorithm creates a geometrical shape based on the number of features of data. This geometrical shape encompasses the reference data point and the neighboring points. The proposed algorithm's efficiency of time, classification, and hashing are evaluated and compared with existing state-of-the-art algorithms.
